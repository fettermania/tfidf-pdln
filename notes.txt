TODO 
---
- Implement TFIDF_Ranker.score / make into a Pipeline-able object
- Note: cross-validation is just to reduce bias from holdout-style validation
- Note that X_train isn't REALLY training data.  How to think about estimating slope?
  - Is it a gradient descent?  Do I have to solve the update rule here?
  - Or is it just generalized hpyerparameter estimation?
- SBM section 3: idf is used in query terms, not in doc weigths
- BM25 - whole system; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25
  - need to learn more core constants
- To optimize:
  - Use PAIRWISE rankings?
    - Note: This exponentially increases the number of "pivots" because there's no P(ret) and P(rel) curves that cross anymore.
  - Metrics (later): Old: precision, recall, f-score.  New: ROC, DCG and variants.
  - Chapelle: Judgement metric for the contest was NDCG 
- TODO: Finding threshold: n-fold cross validation?
  - Probably just a param, like slope
- TODO: Dump to .csv
